# Pima Indians Diabetes Database

- code source: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database">Pima Indians Diabetes (Kaggle)</a>

## Summary

This project is a course conclusion work at the Institute of Information Technology and Management (IGTI) whose objective was to create a Machine Learning model that was able to identify potential cases of diabetes, according to past information such as blood pressure, age , BMI among other variables. Among the tested models, we have:



- KNN Algorithm;
- Decision Tree Algorithm
- and MLP Network



After the necessary adjustments, such as data cleaning, descriptive analysis and model training, an interface was built, using the Flask Framework, which allows the user to enter the necessary data so that the model can indicate whether the characteristics provided suggest or not the development of a diabetes condition.



## Context

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.



## Content

The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, `diabetic`. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.



0. Number of times pregnant.
1. Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
2. Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
3. Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
4. 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
5. Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
6. Diabetes pedigree function.
7. Age (years).
8. Class variable (0 or 1). 



<b>This dataset does not have a defined header.</b> Therefore, I have created a header which are based on the characteristics of each feature.



## Getting Started

If you want to download this repository, just follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository

   `https://github.com/emidiovaleretto/flask-diabetes-prediction.git`

2. Install Python Environment with a requirements.txt file

The `requirements.txt` file should list all Python libraries that the project depend on, and they will be installed using:

‚Äã		`pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Once the libraries are installed, just execute the command line:

   `python app.py`
